# Project
  Male/Female Life Expectancy

Project goal: Using the US Census data prove that females live longer than males.

US Government conducts census every 10 years. Census counts every person living in US regardless
of their citizen status. Census data include age, gender and the home address of the person. Last
census was done in 2010 and the next census will be next year - 2020. Every year in between census
(2011 – 2019), government estimates the population growth and adds the estimated data to the table.

The URL of the census file needed for this project is as follows
https://www2.census.gov/programs-surveys/popest/datasets/2010-2015/national/asrh/nc-est2015-
agesex-res.csv

The population data is broken down by age from 0 – 100. People who are of age more than 100 are
grouped in the last row of age 100.
Interpretation of the first row of data.
• Sex = 0 (means males + females)
• Age = 0 (means babies from age 0 – 1)
• Population in 2010 = 3,944,153 (this is accurate)
• Population in 2011 = 3,963,087 (this is an estimate)
• Population in 2012 = 3,926,540 (this is an estimate)
• …
• Population 2015 = 3,978,038 (this is an estimate)
